Here's an example README.md file for your Bug Bounty tool. This can be used to provide clear instructions on how to use, install, and understand the functionality of the tool.
Bug Bounty Tool

This Python-based tool is designed to help bug bounty hunters identify potential vulnerabilities in web applications. It specifically focuses on detecting common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, NoSQL Injection, and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The tool scans websites using their domain names and generates a report for vulnerabilities found.
Features

    Scans for SQL Injection, NoSQL Injection, and SSRF vulnerabilities.
    Uses payloads from a predefined list (stored in a text file) to test for vulnerabilities.
    Outputs a report with detected vulnerabilities and their severity.

Requirements

    Python 3.x
    Necessary Python libraries:
        requests (for sending HTTP requests)
        bs4 (for parsing HTML)
        time (for generating timestamps)

Installation

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bug-bounty-tool.git
cd bug-bounty-tool

Install the required libraries:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Make sure you have the payload.txt file containing SQL, NoSQL, and SSRF payloads in the same directory or update the file path in the script.

Usage

To run the tool, execute the following command in your terminal:

python3 bug_bounty_tool.py <target_domain>

Replace <target_domain> with the domain of the website you want to test (e.g., example.com).
Example:

python3 bug_bounty_tool.py example.com

The tool will start scanning for vulnerabilities and will output a report with detected vulnerabilities in the terminal.
Vulnerabilities Scanned

    SQL Injection: Tests for vulnerabilities related to improper handling of SQL queries that could allow attackers to manipulate a database.
    NoSQL Injection: Scans for vulnerabilities where NoSQL databases (like MongoDB) could be improperly queried, allowing for data manipulation.
    SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery): Checks for flaws where an attacker could manipulate server-side requests to access internal services.

Example Output

Scanning for vulnerabilities...

Testing for SQL Injection...
No vulnerabilities found.

Testing for NoSQL Injection...
No vulnerabilities found.

Testing for SSRF...
Vulnerability detected! Server-side request forged to internal service: http://localhost:8080

Scan complete. Report saved to report.txt.

Report Output

Once the scan is complete, the tool generates a report with the findings. This report is saved in a file called report.txt with the following format:

[2024-12-02 10:00:00] Vulnerability Detected:
Vulnerability: SSRF
URL: http://example.com/test
Description: Server-side request forged to internal service: http://localhost:8080
Severity: High

Customization

    Payload List: The tool uses payloads for SQL, NoSQL, and SSRF injection tests from a payload.txt file. You can modify the payloads or add new ones to increase detection coverage.

    Timeouts: Adjust the request timeouts in the script to suit your needs (e.g., if you're testing high-latency websites).

    Verbose Mode: You can add a -v flag when running the tool to enable verbose output for debugging or additional information.

Notes

    Legal Disclaimer: This tool is intended for educational purposes only. Ensure you have permission to perform security testing on any website or web application.

    Ethical Use: Always ensure you have explicit permission to perform vulnerability testing on any website, as unauthorized penetration testing can lead to legal consequences.

Troubleshooting

    Issue: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'
        Solution: Run pip install requests to install the missing dependency.

    Issue: Timeout errors during the scan
        Solution: Increase the timeout value in the script to accommodate slower websites.

Additional Notes:

    Update the repository URL in the git clone command to point to your actual repository.
    If the tool uses additional libraries (like requests, beautifulsoup4, etc.), be sure to include them in the requirements.txt file.
    You can modify the payload file or add new ones for testing more vulnerabilities.
    This example provides a high-level structure; you can expand or adjust based on your tool's exact functionality.
